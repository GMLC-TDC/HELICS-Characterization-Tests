This script describes the logic to run this meshed topology federate simulation using python API and commands to run.

This test co-simulates multiple federates talking to each other.
Multiple senders publish messages (a variable) to their connections and the connected federates subscribe to those messages.

There variables involved in this process:
  1. number of federates
  2. number of connections/subscriptions

These inputs are passed as arguments in creating the JSON configuration script.

Running the fedGen.sh script returns,
1.	 the JSON files to create the HELICS federates and 
3.   starts the valuefederate script.

Command to run this shell script : ./fedGen.sh 10 9 (the arguments are sequentially : number of federates, number of connections)
