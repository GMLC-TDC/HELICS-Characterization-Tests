This script describes the logic to run this meshed topology federate simulation using python API and commands to run.

This test co-simulates multiple federates talking to each other.
Multiple senders publish messages (a variable) to their connections and the connected federates subscribe to those messages.

There are multiple variables involved in this process:
  1. number of federates
  2. number of messages per sender
  3. number of bytes per message per sender
  4. number of connections to each federate (should be less than the number of federates)
  4. the update interval (timeDelta) of the helics co-simulation
  5. the stop-time of the co-simulation
  6. the core-type used (ZMQ, TCP, UDP, IP, MPI)
These inputs are passed as arguments in creating the JSON configuration script.

Running the meshGen.sh script returns,
1.	 the JSON files to create the HELICS federates and 
2.	 config_runner.json script that is used by helics runner. This file for now is saved in the log_files folder
3.   starts the helics runner simualtion with the helics config_runner script.

Command to run this shell script : ./meshGen.sh 10 1 1 9 10 1000 zmq (the arguments are sequentially : number of federates, number of messages/federate, number of bytes/message, number of connections, timeDelta, time_stop, coreType)
